Last 2023, our little family visited Hong Kong for Cauchy's first birthday. it's our first international trip! It's my first time in HK as well. But my wife has been there a few years ago.

# Day 1: NAIA to HKIA to Hotel Ease Access Tsuen Wan

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="7" number="1" %}

The flight went smoothly. Cauchy didn't cry on his first airplane ride, and we didn't have to queue as much as there is a special line if you have a baby :D.  We stayed in Hotel Ease Access Tsuen Wan. We didn't do much this day aside from walking around our hotel.

# Day 2: Peak Tram

{% include carousel.html height="50" unit="%" duration="7" number="2" %}

The view on this place is spectacular. It's probably one of the best city views I have ever seen in my entire life. Getting there is no easy task though. We took the MTR from Kwai Fong to Central. I'm really amazed by the train system of HK. There's literally train every 2 minutes! From central, we walk to the Peak Tram station. We could've taken the cab, but where's the fun on that?

# Day 3: Disneyland

{% include carousel.html height="100" unit="%" duration="7" number="3" %}

It's the happiest place on earth indeed! It's my first time on Disneyland, so I'm just as happy as Cauchy LMAO. We had a few priority pass on some rides, so we didn't have to queue as much. Unfortunately, we didn't get to see the fireworks as it rained. (More on this later)

# Day 4-5: Stucked in the Hotel

{% include carousel.html height="100" unit="%" duration="7" number="4" %}

Unfortunately, there was a typhoon. Most establishment are closed. There's no MTR.I have a colleague who has some relative in HK and he gave me a heads up to grab some food a night before lol. Around afternoon on our 5th day, the government updated the typhoon level and we're atleast able to roam around TST.

# Day 6: Going back Home

{% include carousel.html height="100" unit="%" duration="7" number="5" %}

It's our time to go back to the Philippines. We took the airport express. This is from the HK goodies that we got when we first arrived to HK. This is such an amazing place, and for sure we will be back. Hopefully no typhoon the next time.
