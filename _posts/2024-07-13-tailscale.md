Tailscale is my service of choice to giving the mentees access to VMs in my homelab. It's an easy to use solution. I can whitelist precisely which machines I want them to access without exposing my entire network. Setting up tailscale is as easy as follows:

1. Create an account via  [https://tailscale.com/](https://tailscale.com/)
2. Download tailscale into your machine using [https://tailscale.com/download](https://tailscale.com/download)

You can confirm if you are connected to your tailnet if the machines is here:

3. Wait for the invite link that i will send you to access the VM.
4. Test if you can ping the VM.

And that's it!
