I'm Benjamin Cabalona Jr. A Data Science Manager during the day and with a passion for HomeLab setupsâ€”I enjoy cosplaying as a system administrator at home. Besides that, I'm a proud dad, a gymrat, and always into looking sharp. I have recently launched **Project Cauchy**, which aims to solve the *you need experience to get experience* by providing people with real-world experience in data science. If you're interested in joining the project, feel free to connect with us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sQMUDnyd).
