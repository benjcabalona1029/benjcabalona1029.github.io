Last 2023, our little family visited Hong Kong for Cauchy's first birthday. it's our first international trip! It's my first time in HK as well. But my wife has been there a few years ago.

# Day 1: NAIA to HKIA to Hotel Ease Access Tsuen Wan!

The flight went smoothly. Cauchy didn't cry on his first airplane ride, and we didn't have to queue as much as there is a special line if you have a baby :D.  We stayed in Hotel Ease Access Tsuen Wan. We didn't do much this day aside from walking around our hotel.

# Day 2: Peak Tram

The view on this place is spectacular. It's probably one of the best city views I have ever seen in my entire life. Getting there is no easy task though. We took the MTR from Kwai Fong to Central. I'm really amazed by the train system of HK. There's literally train every 2 minutes! From central, we walk to the Peak Tram station. We could've taken the cab, but where's the fun on that?
