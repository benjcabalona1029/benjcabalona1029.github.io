We all know the paradox of needing experience to get an experience. To give back to the data community, I’ll take 3-4 aspiring data professional for a build your data portfolio project. The goal is to give you an idea how it feels to be an actual analyst/de/ds.

I’m a new Data Manager, and this is also my way of improving my code review skills, and my project management skills.

- I’ll let you connect to my infrastructure via VPN.
- Jira for project management
- We’ll build the data generating process (via FastAPI ) based on my industry (Gaming Industry)
- Replicate the Prod DB (MySQL to MySQL)
- Ingest from replica db to datalakehouse (MySQL to MinIO (this is a locally hosted object store that follow S3API) and DuckDB as analytic DB)
- Build a dashboard using Plotly Dash
- Fraud detection for ML

This is not for complete beginners though. You need to at least know SQL and Python.
