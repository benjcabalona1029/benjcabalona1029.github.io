Last 2023, our little family visited Hong Kong for Cauchy's first birthday. it's our first international trip! It's my first time in HK as well. But my wife has been there a few years ago.

The flight went smoothly. Cauchy didn't cry on his first airplane ride, and we didn't have to queue as much as there is a special line if you have a baby :D.  We stayed in Hotel Ease Access Tsuen Wan. We didn't do much this day aside from walking around our hotel.
